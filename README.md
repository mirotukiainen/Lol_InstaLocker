## Instalock-tool for League of Legends

### Overview
*I'm Making this project just for fun, and the idea was just to automate picking a champion in League of Legends. This isn't anything usable really, since blind pick isn't a thing anymore, and instalocking in ranked is kind of redundant.*

  1. [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  2. [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
  3. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (Necessary for some of PyAutoGUI's functions)
